# Hourly Rate Calculator ðŸ’¸

The Hourly Rate Calculator is a simple web application that enables users to calculate their earnings based on the hours worked. This project was developed as a personal study in JavaScript and created for personal use in calculating hours worked for freelancing projects. 
 

## Features
This application allows users to enter the hourly rate, hours, and minutes worked, and then, the calculated earnings (in Brazilian Reais) will be displayed on the screen.

 If minutes are not provided, the calculator assumes zero minutes. The application checks for valid inputs and displays an error message if the inputs are not valid.
